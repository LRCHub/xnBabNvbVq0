I am leaving this harbor
Giving urban a farewell
Its habitants seem too keen in God
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs

Wanderlust, relentlessly craving wanderlust
Peel off the layers
Until you get to the core

Did I imagine it would be like this?
Was it something like this I wished for
Or will I want more?
Or will I want more?

Lust for comfort suffocates the soul
This relentless restlessness liberates me

I feel at home whenever
The unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace
Aboard my floating house

Wanderlust, from Island to Island
Wanderlust, immovement
Wanderfool, I'm jailed with you
